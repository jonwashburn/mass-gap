# Yang-Mills / Reality Integration: The Unconditional Proof Plan

## 1. Overview

**Goal:** To complete the unconditional proof of the Yang-Mills mass gap by using the `reality` repository's formal framework as a meta-spine. This document outlines the remaining "non-spec" mathematical work required to transform the spec-level YM proof into a fully constructive, unconditional one.

## 2. The Two Pillars

This project synthesizes two distinct but complementary repositories:

### The `reality` Repository: A Framework for Physics

This is a meta-framework that claims to be a unique and minimal formal system for describing reality itself. Its apex certificate, **`PrimeClosure`**, proves this by bundling five key pillars:

1.  **`RSRealityMaster` (Empirical Coherence):** Asserts that "Recognition Science measures reality." It binds the abstract framework to empirical data through a "units-quotient bridge," ensuring that the model's dimensionless outputs match reality at the golden ratio scale (`φ`).
2.  **`FrameworkUniqueness` (Uniqueness):** Proves that any two frameworks satisfying the core axioms are isomorphic up to a choice of units, asserting there is fundamentally only *one* self-consistent way to construct such a framework.
3.  **`MPMinimal` (Axiom Minimality):** Establishes that the foundational axiom set (the "Measurement Problem" axioms) is both necessary and sufficient.
4.  **`Spatial3_necessity` (Dimensional Collapse):** Proves that the framework is only consistent in exactly 3 spatial dimensions by showing a synchronization condition (`lcm(2^D, 45) = 360`) only holds for `D=3`.
5.  **`generations_exact_three` (Structural Collapse):** Proves there are exactly three generations of matter.

**Deeper Meaning:** `PrimeClosure` formalizes the claim that this framework isn't just *a* model of reality, but the *only possible* self-consistent one built from these principles.

### The `YM` Repository: A Specific Physical Theory

This repository contains a formal, but largely "spec-level," proof of the Yang-Mills mass gap. It correctly lays out the mathematical objects and proof strategy (OS axioms, transfer operators, Doeblin minorization, continuum limit via NRC, etc.) but leaves the "non-spec math" — the hard analytical proofs — as placeholders. We have now structurally integrated the Reality framework's constants into `YMFramework.lean`.

## 3. The Grand Synthesis

The `reality` framework provides the **spine** and the `YM` proof provides the **flesh**. The YM proof becomes the first major, non-trivial *witness* to the claims made by `PrimeClosure`.

The remaining "non-spec math" is not just about proving generic theorems, but about proving them *within the constraints of the Reality framework*.

-   **Derive YM Constants from `phi`:** The constants in the YM proof (`θ_*`, `t₀`, `λ₁(G)`) cannot be arbitrary. The Reality framework fixes all dimensionless constants. The next steps will use adapters in `YM/RealityAdapters.lean` to derive these YM constants from `phi`. This will make the YM mass gap `γ_* = -log(q_*)` a function of `phi`, not a free parameter.
-   **Structure Proofs via Certificates:** The certificates in `reality` (e.g., `eight_tick_report`, `cone_bound_report`) provide the blueprint for the *structure* of the YM proof. The next steps will implement the YM-specific versions of these proofs in the `YM` modules.

## 4. The Unconditional Proof Workflow (The "Non-Spec" Math)

The following high-level mathematical components must be proven concretely to complete the proof.

1.  **OS/GNS and Lattice Measure:** Build the actual Reflection-Positivity (RP) Gibbs measure for Wilson SU(N) on finite 4D tori, construct the OS/GNS Hilbert space, and define the transfer operator `T=e^{-aH}` on it. Prove `T ≥ 0` and `IsSelfAdjoint T`.
2.  **Doeblin/Heat-Kernel Minorization:** Prove the interface convex split on fixed physical slabs by formalizing heat-kernel short-time lower bounds and small-ball convolution on SU(N). Establish the constants `(θ_*, t0)` and prove they are β‑independent and volume‑uniform.
3.  **Lattice Gap (Mean-Zero/Odd Sector):** From the minorization, derive `q_* = 1 − θ_* e^{−λ₁ t₀} ∈ (0,1)`. Prove the odd‑cone/eight‑tick contraction and the uniform spectral gap on finite tori, relating the gap to `−log q_*`.
4.  **Continuum Limit and Gap Persistence:** Prove UEI/equicontinuity and isotropy on fixed regions. Establish resolvent/semigroup convergence (operator‑norm or strong‑resolvent/Mosco) along van Hove sequences. Replace the NRC spec with a concrete resolvent comparison and deduce persistence of a positive continuum mass gap.
5.  **Full OS→Wightman Stack:** Verify OS0–OS5 for the limiting Schwinger functions using the constructed measure. Perform the OS→Wightman reconstruction with proofs of Poincaré covariance and microcausality.
6.  **End-to-End Constant Wiring:** Thread the proven `(θ_*, t0, λ₁(G))` through the framework, removing all placeholders.

## 5. Actionable Plan & Requeueable Prompt

The workflow can be executed by requeueing the following prompt until all items are complete.

```markdown
### Prompt: Unconditional YM Proof Step <N>: <Goal>

Context:
- Use the Reality framework (phi, units, axiom minimality) via `YM/RealityAdapters.lean` as the spine.
- All proofs must be Real-native, with no axioms/sorries.
- Cite manuscript lines from `Yang-Mills-sept21.tex` for the YM-specific steps.

Task <N>: <e.g., Prove SU(N) Heat-Kernel Lower Bound>
- In file(s) <e.g., YM/OSWilson/HeatKernelLowerBound.lean>:
  1. Formalize the necessary Lie group / PDE theory (extending mathlib if needed).
  2. Prove the short-time lower bound for the SU(N) heat kernel.
  3. Derive the constants (e.g., `t₀`) as functions of RS parameters.
  4. Ensure `lake build` passes.

Acceptance: The module contains a concrete, unconditional proof of <...>, consistent with the Reality framework's constraints.

## 6. Definition of Done

The project is complete when:
- All "non-spec" items from the workflow are fully implemented in Lean.
- All proofs are `ℝ`-native, with no `Float` stubs remaining.
- No `sorry`, `admit`, axioms, or tautologies remain in the `YM` proof chain.
- The YM mass gap `γ_*` is derived as a function of `phi` and other RS constants.
- The full `lake build` passes.
