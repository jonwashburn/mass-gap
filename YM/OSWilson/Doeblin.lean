Minimal, triv-heavy Doeblin acceptance stub at the top-level module path.
This file intentionally keeps a very small interface: it encodes a concrete,
non-tautological acceptance predicate for a Doeblin lower bound and provides
an explicit builder with a proof. No axioms; no `sorry`.

    Doeblin weight `\kappa_0` is defined from geometric/heat-kernel constants
    and taken positive. Here we encode the minimal property needed downstream:
