# YM-Plus: Unified Recognition Science and Yang-Mills Proof

## Overview

This project combines the Recognition Science (RS) framework with the Yang-Mills mass gap proof to achieve a complete, parameter-free derivation of the mass gap using topological principles.

## Key Insights

The Yang-Mills mass gap emerges naturally from the RS framework as:
- **Mass gap**: γ₀ = ln(φ) ≈ 0.481 (the golden gap)
- **Source**: Topological link penalty from 3D minimal resolution requirements
- **β-independence**: The gap is topological, not dynamical, avoiding the β→∞ issue

## Repository Structure

- `reality/`: Recognition Science framework (IndisputableMonolith)
- `ym2/`: Original Yang-Mills proof attempt
- `unified/`: Combined proof leveraging both frameworks

## Core Principles

### From Recognition Science:
1. **Meta-Principle**: "Nothing cannot recognize itself" forces existence of recognition
2. **Eight-tick cycle**: Minimal period T=8 for 3D space (2^D where D=3)
3. **Cost functional**: J(x) = ½(x + 1/x) - 1 (unique symmetric convex cost)
4. **Golden ratio**: φ emerges from self-similarity fixed point
5. **Link penalty**: ΔJ ≥ ln(φ) for linked configurations in 3D

### Application to Yang-Mills:
1. **Gauge fields as ledgers**: Non-abelian extension of ledger conservation
2. **Curvature as flux**: Imbalances from non-commutativity
3. **Mass gap as recognition cost**: Minimal energy for unresolved parities
4. **Topological origin**: Independent of coupling strength β

## Mathematical Bridge

The bridge between RS and YM is established through:
- Non-abelian Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC)
- G-valued cochains with Maurer-Cartan structure
- Conservation law: d₂F + [A,F] = 0 (Bianchi identity)
- Cost functional mapping to Yang-Mills action

## Proof Status

### Completed:
- [x] Repository structure and initial analysis
- [x] Identification of golden gap as mass gap value
- [x] Topological interpretation of β-independence

### In Progress:
- [ ] Lean formalization of combined framework
- [ ] Non-abelian DEC implementation
- [ ] Formal verification of γ₀ = ln(φ)

### Next Steps:
1. Create unified Lean project combining both codebases
2. Implement NonAbelianCochain structure extending CochainSpace
3. Prove mass gap persistence through NRC with topological bounds
4. Verify Clay Institute requirements are met
